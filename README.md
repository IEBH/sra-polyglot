# Polyglot Search Translator
This module is part of the [Bond University Centre for Research in Evidence-Based Practice](https://github.com/IEBH) Systematic Review Assistant suite of tools.

When given a complex search query in either PubMed or Ovid MEDLINE format it will attempt to translate it to any of the supported search engine formats.

It forms the [Polyglot Search Syntax Translator](http://sr-accelerator.com/#/polyglot) module of the [Systematic Review Accelerator](http://sr-accelerator.com).

# Usage Guide
A search query can be specified in either PubMed query format, Ovid MEDLINE format or a mix of the two. Most of the usual search query syntax will be supported by Polyglot by default.

The following sub-headings break down each individual syntax.

**General notes**:

* Generally you can use either PubMed or Ovid MEDLINE query syntax without any issue
* By default queries referenced by line number will be grouped
* Multiple terms can be grouped using speachmarks but this is optional
* [Comments](#comments) can be specified to make your search strategy easier to read in future
* [Templates](#templates) are supported allowing inserts of compound search terms which can be specific to different output engines


## Plain-text phrases
To search for basic phrases simply specify the words within the search term with or without being enclosed in speachmarks. Specific search fields can be specified by appending it to the term in any of the following supported formats:

* `Term` (Generic search in all fields, polyglot will undeline the word in blue: [Replacing Empty Field Tags](#replacing-empty-field-tags))
* `Term[ti]` (PubMed field specification, fields also supported: `tiab`, `ti`, `tw`, `ab`, `nm`, `sh`, `pt`, `la`)
* `Term.ti.` or `Term:ti` (Ovid MEDLINE field specification, fields also supported: `tw`, `ti,ab`, `ab,ti`, `ti`, `ab`, `mp`, `nm`, `pt`, `fs`, `sh`, `xm`, `lg`)


## Mesh Headings
To search for a supported Mesh term use any of the following:

* `Term[Mesh]` (exploded Mesh heading, PubMed format)
* `Term[Mesh:NoExp]` (non-exploded Mesh heading, PubMed format)
* `Term[Majr]` or `Term[MeSH Major Topic]` (Major Mesh heading, PubMed format)
* `exp Term/` (exploded Mesh heading, Ovid MEDLINE format #1)
* `exp *Term/` (Major Mesh heading, Ovid MEDLINE format #1)
* `Term/` (non-exploded Mesh heading, Ovid MEDLINE format #1)
* `Term.xm.` (exploded Mesh heading, Ovid MEDLINE format #2)
* `Term.sh.` (non-exploded Mesh heading, Ovid MEDLINE format #2)


## Logical Syntax
Any of the following keywords can be used to join multiple phrases together:

* `Term1 AND Term2`
* `Term1 OR Term2`
* `Term1 NOT Term2`
* `(Term1 OR Term2) AND (Term3 OR Term4)` (logical grouping using brackets)

All keywords are case insensitive (i.e. `and` works the same as `AND` or `And`).


## Proximity searching
Similar to [Logical Syntax](#logical-syntax), proximity searching allows the searching of a secondary term within the range of the primary:

* `Term1 ADJ3 Term2` (Search for `Term2` within 3 words of `Term1`, Ovid MEDLINE format)
* `Term1 NEAR3 Term2` (Search for `Term2` within 3 words of `Term1`, Cochrane Library format)
* `Term1 N3 Term2` (Search for `Term2` within 3 words of `Term1`, CINAHL format)
* `Term1 NEAR/3 Term2` (Search for `Term2` within 3 words of `Term1`, Embase and Web of Science formats)


## Line Referencing
There are two main methods to number lines, either leave the beggining of the line blank and use the numbers provided in the left hand side of the editor, or specify a custom number at the begining of each line.
Automatic line expansion can be used by enabling the checkbox.
**If you specify a line number at the beginning of a line, all lines must be numbered.**

![blank line number](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25999161/61197739-d3be5d00-a719-11e9-94ab-60f3bd00175a.png)

![custom line number](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25999161/61197858-5c3cfd80-a71a-11e9-83ff-cda3adce3a76.png)

To reference a certain line simply insert the line number before or after [Logical Syntax](#logical-syntax). Any lines that are referenced will be automatically grouped

```
1. foo[ti]
2. baz[tiab]
3. 1 OR 2
4. bar[ti]
5. 3 AND 4
```

![output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25999161/61197608-43801800-a719-11e9-8d61-b54ad5c50368.png)


## Bracket Expansion
While Ovid Medline supports using field tags on groups, PubMed doesn't, so any time a group contains a field tag on the end, it will be expanded for any engines which do not support field tags on groups.

**e.g. Ovid to PubMed** `(foo or bar).ti. --> (foo[ti] or bar[ti])`


## Replacing Empty Field Tags
Any time there is a phrase without a field tag (a generic search for all fields), a dashed blue underline will appear underneath it. Clicking on the word will bring up a dialogue box which will allow you to specify a field tag to replace the missing field tag for either just that word or all phrases with no field tags.

![box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25999161/61197578-07e54e00-a719-11e9-96b3-b64d0282fff3.png)


## Tooltips
Any time a black dotted line appears underneath a word, howver over it to display a tooltip with more information. These tooltips will usually appear to inform the user when polyglot makes a decision on their behalf.

**e.g. When attempting to convert foo.ab. from and Ovid Medline Search to PubMed, because PubMed does not support searching the abstract field term by itself Polyglot translates it to the Title and Abstract field term.**

![tooltip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25999161/61197414-2e56b980-a718-11e9-91ff-64979e3ea765.png)


## Templates
These are specified using the `<Template ID>` syntax.

For example the "RCT Filter" template (specified via `<RCT Filter>` in Polglot) has a specific syntax in PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE and in some search engines is omitted all other. Using templates allows Polyglot to correctly swap the synax based on the output engine.

| Template ID	| Description                  	|
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `<rct filter>`| Standard Cochrane RCT Filter	|
| `<sr filter>` | Standard Cochrane SR Filter	|
| `<engine>` 	| The current output engine 	|


## Comments
Comments allow you to add notes within your search strategy which will be removed from the output.
These allow you to write your query in a human-readable way without effecting the output in each search engine.

To use comments simply add a hash character (`#`) anywhere on a line. Any text *after* that character will be ignored until the next line.


# For Developers

## Updating Polyglot
To update polyglot, update spreadsheet and then replace `data/v4.xlsx` with spreadsheet
Run `npm run preprocess` to update translations and republish
## Input Output API
```javascript
polyglot = require('sra-polyglot').default;

var queries = polyglot.translateAll('"Primary Health Care"[Mesh] OR Primary care OR Primary healthcare OR Family practice OR General practice\n\nAND\n\n"Treatment Failure"[Mesh] OR Treatment failure OR Treatment failures\n\nAND\n\n"Bacterial Infections"[Mesh] OR Bacteria OR Bacterial\n\nAND\n\n"Anti-Bacterial Agents"[Mesh] OR Antibacterial Agents OR Antibacterial Agent OR Antibiotics OR Antibiotic');

console.log(queries);
```

Will output an object structure like:

```json
{
	"pubmed": "(\"Primary Health Care\"[MESH] OR Primary care OR Primary healthcare OR Family practice OR General practice)\n\nAND\n\n(\"Treatment Failure\"[MESH] OR Treatment failure OR Treatment failures)\n\nAND\n\n(\"Bacterial Infections\"[MESH] OR Bacteria OR Bacterial)\n\nAND\n\n(\"Anti-Bacterial Agents\"[MESH] OR Antibacterial Agents OR Antibacterial Agent OR Antibiotics OR Antibiotic)",
	"ovid": "(exp Primary Health Care/ OR Primary care OR Primary healthcare OR Family practice OR General practice)\n\nAND\n\n(exp Treatment Failure/ OR Treatment failure OR Treatment failures)\n\nAND\n\n(exp Bacterial Infections/ OR Bacteria OR Bacterial)\n\nAND\n\n(exp Anti-Bacterial Agents/ OR Antibacterial Agents OR Antibacterial Agent OR Antibiotics OR Antibiotic)",

	"embase": "('Primary Health Care'/exp OR Primary care OR Primary healthcare OR Family practice OR General practice)\n\nAND\n\n('Treatment Failure'/exp OR Treatment failure OR Treatment failures)\n\nAND\n\n('Bacterial Infections'/exp OR Bacteria OR Bacterial)\n\nAND\n\n('Anti-Bacterial Agents'/exp OR Antibacterial Agents OR Antibacterial Agent OR Antibiotics OR Antibiotic)",
	"webofscience": "(Primary care OR Primary healthcare OR Family practice OR General practice)\n\nAND\n\n(Treatment failure OR Treatment failures)\n\nAND\n\n(Bacteria OR Bacterial)\n\nAND\n\n(Antibacterial Agents OR Antibacterial Agent OR Antibiotics OR Antibiotic)",
	"cinahl": "((MH \"Primary Health Care+\") OR Primary care OR Primary healthcare OR Family practice OR General practice)\n\nAND\n\n((MH \"Treatment Failure+\") OR Treatment failure OR Treatment failures)\n\nAND\n\n((MH \"Bacterial Infections+\") OR Bacteria OR Bacterial)\n\nAND\n\n((MH \"Anti-Bacterial Agents+\") OR Antibacterial Agents OR Antibacterial Agent OR Antibiotics OR Antibiotic)"
}
```

## Parsed Tree Object
This section is only intended for people who are interested in the inner working of the parsing tree used by Polyglot.

Each of the following sub-sections describes a node which can be contained within the compiled tree returned by `Polyglot.parse(query)`.

The result tree can then be fed into `Polyglot.engines.ENGINE.compile(tree)` to return the translated search.


### group
